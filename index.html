      <h1>My Home Page</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi, welcome to my home page. I'm gonna talk about a few hobbies I have briefly. On this page I'll go over my history with music and some information about my high school's esports team.</p>

      <h2>I Like Playing Music</h2>
      <p>I've been playing the piano since I was 6 years old and I still do now. This doesn't really mean I'm some sort of prodigy but I'm good enough to play songs that make me happy. I still practice a little every week have been trying to learn some fun songs like "Claire-De-Lune" and "Linus and Lucy." Although, mainly, I enjoy playing music with other people. Every once in a while my friend will invite me to play piano/keyboard at a block party or a barbeque by his house and I we either practice a few songs before hand; or, I find chords online and try to learn some kind of arrangement on the spot.</p>
      
      <p>I also play the clarinet in my high school band. Clarinet is something I've been playing for less time. I joined my middle school band and started learning when I was 10 and I only really played during school. I like playing clarinet but its not as much fun to practice alone as it is to play in a larger group. Playing with other instruments creates a fuller sound that I find more enjoyment knowing I'm a part of, rather than improving at a solo piece at home. Playing the clarinet might just become a random talent I have in the future, unless I pursue something later in life that keeps me playing.</p>
    
      <h2>Esports</h2>
      <p>This year I joined my high school's esports team to play Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. This still feels a little embarssing to admit to people but I do actually have a lot of fun with the club and the embarssment is really just in my head so its okay. In the club, I attend monthly tournaments where we play a group format of cycling through players called a crew battle. The most recent event for the Illinois High School Esports Assosiation (IHSEA), was held at Leydon High school.</p>

      <p>Anyway, this was the second event we attendended. The first event we managed to get 2nd place out of 9 other teams, but this most recent event we only placed 7th, going 1-2 in our bracket. The team plans to practice twice a week in preparation for our next event and I'm excited to see how the club goes over the course of the rest of the year.</p>
